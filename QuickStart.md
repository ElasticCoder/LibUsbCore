# QuickStart
## Familiarisation
Build and run the Test Console application. It will enumerate the devices on your system.

## Windows
If you want to read and write to a device you may need to replace the driver with a WinUSB driver.
The quickest way is to run [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and select the device you wish to replace the driver with.
> Note: this will replace your driver but it is reversible - please read the documentation.
